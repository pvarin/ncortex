Welcome to the nCortex documentation!
=====================================

nCortex, short for neocortex, is a repository for both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning implementations, with a specific focus on robotics.

The focus of this project is to provide:

    - Good implementations of model-based and model-free RL algorithms
    - Support for learning on differentiable and non-differentiable dynamics
    - Low activation-cost environment for RL experimentation
    - Good, complete diagnostic tools, with tensorboard logging
